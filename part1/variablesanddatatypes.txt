Variables and Simple Data Types

Traceback: when you make a mistake in your code the interpreter provides a traceback to help you identify where
the mistake occured.

Useful string methods:
.title() prints the string with the first letter of each word in upper case
.lower() prints all lower case
.upper() prints all upper case

Using f-strings
f-strings (format strings) are usefull since you don't have to use + simbol to concatenate
example:

name = 'john'
last_name = 'doe'
full_name = f'{name} {last_name}'

Scape character '\'
examples:
tab \t
new line \n
new line and tab \n\t

Stripping white space

.rstrip() strips white space from the right end of the string
.lstrip() strips left end of the string
.strip() strips both ends
