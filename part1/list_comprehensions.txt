A way to generate lists without the need of several lines of code is a list comprehension. This way we can
combine the declaration of the list, the expression we want to use for each individual object, and the for loop
in a single line. Each value will be automatically appended to the list. Example of list comprehension.

squares = [i**2 for i in range(0,11)]

No colon or comas are needed. Here is an example of a list of strings

strings = [f"number: {i}" for i in range(0, 21)]
